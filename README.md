## tinder-profile-analysis:
- final project for CS240 turned into my personal research project and excuse for me to learn more advanced tools that I haven't learned yet

## TODO:

    - <strike>**graph** common interests; males vs males, females vs females, males vs females</strike>

- <strike>optional prompts</strike>
    - <strike>how many filled out all 3, 2, 1 etc (get count of how many people filled out n many optional prompts)</strike>

    - <strike>**graph** top 3 anthem genres between males, females, and all profiles</strike>

- create models such that I can predict x things based on y
- attempt to get more profiles and/or more advanced statistics about the profiles
    - take a random sample size of a larger dataset for a more random analysis
